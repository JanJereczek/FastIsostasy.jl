Models specifically designed for ice-sheet modelling, such as Bueler et al. 2007 and Coulon et al. 2021, have shown first improvements in closing the gap between simplistic and expensive models. FastIsostasy continues this work by generalizing both of these contributions into one, while benchmarking results against 1D and 3D GIA models.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"FastIsostasy heavily relies on the Fast-Fourier Transform (FFT), as (1) its central PDE is solved by applying a Fourier collocation scheme and (2) important diagnostic fields are computed by matrix convolutions which can famously be accelerated by the use of FFT. FFT therefore inspired the name \"FastIsostasy\", along with a GitHub repository that eased the first steps of this package. The use of a performant language such as julia, as well as supporting performance-relevant computations on GPU allows FastIsostasy to live up to the expectations of low computation time.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"We believe that FastIsostasy drastically reduces the burdens associated with using a 3D GIA model while offering all the complexity needed for ice-sheet modelling.
