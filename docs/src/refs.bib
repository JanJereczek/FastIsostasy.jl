	abstract = {The model used by Lingle and Clark (1985) to approximate the deformation of the Earth under a single ice stream is adapted to the purposes of continent-scale ice-sheet simulation. The model combines a layered elastic spherical Earth (Farrell, 1972) with a viscous half-space overlain by an elastic plate lithosphere (Cathles, 1975). For the half-space model we identify a new mathematical formulation, essentially a time-dependent partial differential equation, which generalizes and improves upon the standard elastic plate lithosphere with relaxing asthenosphere model widely used in ice-sheet simulation. The new formulation allows a significantly faster numerical strategy, a spectral collocation method based directly on the fast Fourier transform. We verify this method by comparing to an integral formula for a disk load. We also demonstrate that the magnitudes of numerical errors made in approximating coupled ice-flow/Earth-deformation systems are significantly smaller than pairwise differences between several Earth models. Our implementation of the Lingle and Clark (1985) model offers important features of spherical, layered, self-gravitating, viscoelastic Earth models without the computational expense.},

These contrasts suggest differences in the response timescale of mantle ﬂow across the continent, similar to those documented between the northeastern and southwestern upper mantle of North America. Glacial isostatic adjustment and geodynamical modelling rely on independent estimates of lateral variability in effective viscosity. Recent improvements in imaging techniques and the distribution of seismic stations now allow resolution of both lateral and vertical variability of seismic velocity, making detailed inferences about lateral viscosity variations possible. Geodetic and palaeosea-level investigations of Antarctica provide quantitative ways of independently assessing the 3D mantle viscosity structure. While observational and causal connections between inferred lateral viscosity variability and seismic velocity changes are qualitatively reconciled, signiﬁcant improvements in the quantitative relations between effective viscosity anomalies and those imaged by P- and S-wave tomography have remained elusive. Here we describe several methods for estimating effective viscosity from S-wave velocity. We then present and compare maps of the viscosity variability beneath Antarctica based on the recent S-wave velocity model ANT-20 using three different approaches.},

Here we review recent seismic structure models and describe their implications for the dynamics and history of the Antarctic upper mantle. Results show that most of East Antarctica is underlain by continental lithosphere to depths of approximately 200 km. The thickest lithosphere is found in a band 500–1000 km inboard from the Transantarctic Mountains, representing the continuation of cratonic lithosphere with Australian afﬁnity beneath the ice. Dronning Maud Land and the Lambert Graben show much thinner lithosphere, consistent with Phanerozoic lithospheric disruption. The Transantarctic Mountains mark a sharp boundary between cratonic lithosphere and the warmer upper mantle of West Antarctica. In the southern Transantarctic Mountains, cratonic lithosphere has been replaced by warm asthenosphere, giving rise to Cenozoic volcanism and an elevated mountainous region. The Marie Byrd Land volcanic dome is underlain by slow seismic velocities extending through the transition zone, consistent with a mantle plume. Slow-velocity anomalies beneath the coast from the Amundsen Sea Embayment to the Antarctic Peninsula are likely to result from upwelling of warm asthenosphere during subduction of the Antarctic–Phoenix spreading centre.},

	abstract = {The study of glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) is gaining an increasingly important role within the geophysical community. Understanding the response of the Earth to loading is crucial in various contexts, ranging from the interpretation of modern satellite geodetic measurements (e.g. GRACE and GOCE) to the projections of future sea level trends in response to climate change. Modern modelling approaches to GIA are based on various techniques that range from purely analytical formulations to fully numerical methods. Despite various teams independently investigating GIA, we do not have a suitably large set of agreed numerical results through which the methods may be validated; a community benchmark data set would clearly be valuable. Following the example of the mantle convection community, here we present, for the ﬁrst time, the results of a benchmark study of codes designed to model GIA. This has taken place within a collaboration facilitated through European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST) Action ES0701. The approaches benchmarked are based on signiﬁcantly different codes and different techniques. The test computations are based on models with spherical symmetry and Maxwell rheology and include inputs from different methods and solution techniques: viscoelastic normal modes, spectral-ﬁnite elements and ﬁnite elements. The tests involve the loading and tidal Love numbers and their relaxation spectra, the deformation and gravity variations driven by surface loads characterized by simple geometry and time history and the rotational ﬂuctuations in response to glacial unloading. In spite of the signiﬁcant differences in the numerical methods employed, the test computations show a satisfactory agreement between the results provided by the participants.},

The results show that incorporating lateral variations in Earth’s structure across Antarctica yields local differences in the modeled ice history and introduces signiﬁcant uncertainty in estimates of both relative sea level change and modern crustal motions through the last deglaciation. An analysis indicates that the contribution of glacial isostatic adjustment to modern records of sea level change and solid Earth deformation in regions of Antarctica underlain by low mantle viscosity may be more sensitive to ice loading during the late Holocene than across the last deglaciation.},

This paper reviews the various methods normally used in the ice-sheet modelling community to deal with the bedrock response and compares these with a more sophisticated full-Earth model. Each of these bedrock treatments, five in total, is coupled with a three-dimensional thermomechanical ice-sheet model under the same forcing conditions to simulate the Antarctic ice sheet during the last glacial cycle. The outputs of the simulations are compared on the basis of the time-dependent behaviour for the total ice volume and the mean bedrock elevation during the cycle and of the present rate of uplift over Antarctica. This comparison confirms the necessity of accounting for the elastic bending of the lithosphere in order to yield realistic bedrock patterns. It furthermore demonstrates the deficiencies inherent to the diffusion equation in modelling the complex deformation within the mantle. Nevertheless, when characteristic parameters are varied within their range of uncertainty, differences within one single method are often of the same order as those between the various methods. This overview finally attempts to point out the main advantages and drawbacks of each of these methods and to determine which one is most appropriate depending on the specific modelling requirements.},

	abstract = {The Antarctic ice sheet (AIS) lies on a solid Earth that displays large spatial variations in rheological properties, with a thin lithosphere and low-viscosity upper mantle (weak Earth structure) beneath West Antarctica and an opposing structure beneath East Antarctica. This contrast is known to have a significant impact on the ice-sheet grounding-line stability. Here, we embed within an icesheet model a modified glacial-isostatic Elastic Lithosphere-Relaxing Asthenosphere model that considers a dual pattern for the Earth structure beneath West and East Antarctica supplemented with an approximation of gravitationally consistent geoid changes, allowing to approximate near-field relative sea-level changes. We show that this elementary GIA model captures the essence of global SelfGravitating Viscoelastic solid-Earth Models (SGVEMs) and compares well with both SGVEM outputs and geodetic observations, allowing to capture the essential features and processes influencing Antarctic grounding-line stability in a computationally efficient way. In this framework, we perform a probabilistic assessment of the impact of uncertainties in solid-Earth rheological properties on the response of the AIS to future warming. Results show that on multicentennial-to-millennial timescales, spatial variability in solid-Earth deformation plays a significant role in promoting the stability of the West Antarctic ice sheet (WAIS). However, WAIS collapse cannot be prevented under high-emissions climate scenarios. On longer timescales and for unmitigated climate scenarios, continent-wide mass loss projections may be underestimated because spatially uniform Earth models, as typically considered in numerical ice sheet models, will overestimate the stabilizing effect of GIA across East Antarctica, which is characterized by thick lithosphere and high upper-mantle viscosity.},

With isostatic adjustment of the bedrock and external sea-level forcing that is not a result of mass changes of the ice sheet under consideration, this approach breaks down, because ice volume above ﬂoatation can be modiﬁed without actual changes in the sea-level contribution.

	abstract = {We describe and present results from a ﬁnite-volume (FV) parallel computer code for forward modelling the Maxwell viscoelastic response of a 3-D, self-gravitating, elastically compressible Earth to an arbitrary surface load. We implement a conservative, control volume discretization of the governing equations using a tetrahedral grid in Cartesian geometry and a low-order, linear interpolation. The basic starting grid honours all major radial discontinuities in the Preliminary Reference Earth Model (PREM), and the models are permitted arbitrary spatial variations in viscosity and elastic parameters. These variations may be either continuous or discontinuous at a set of grid nodes forming a 3-D surface within the (regional or global) modelling domain. In the second part of the paper, we adopt the FV methodology and a spherically symmetric Earth model to generate a suite of predictions sampling a broad class of glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) data types (3-D crustal motions, long-wavelength gravity anomalies). These calculations, based on either a simple disc load history or a global Late Pleistocene ice load reconstruction (ICE-3G), are benchmarked against predictions generated using the traditional normal-mode approach to GIA. The detailed comparison provides a guide for future analyses (e.g. what grid resolution is required to obtain a speciﬁc accuracy?) and it indicates that discrepancies in predictions of 3-D crustal velocities less than 0.1 mm yr−1 are generally obtainable for global grids with ∼3 × 106 nodes; however, grids of higher resolution are required to predict large-amplitude ({\textgreater}1 cm yr−1) radial velocities in zones of peak postglacial uplift (e.g. James bay) to the same level of absolute accuracy. We conclude the paper with a ﬁrst application of the new formulation to a 3-D problem. Speciﬁcally, we consider the impact of mantle viscosity heterogeneity on predictions of present-day 3-D crustal motions in North America. In these tests, the lateral viscosity variation is constructed, with suitable scaling, from tomographic images of seismic S-wave heterogeneity, and it is characterized by approximately 2 orders of magnitude (peak-to-peak) lateral variations within the lower mantle and 1 order of magnitude variations in the bulk of the upper mantle (below the asthenosphere). We ﬁnd that the introduction of 3-D viscosity structure has a profound impact on horizontal velocities; indeed, the magnitude of the perturbation (of order 1 mm yr−1) is as large as the prediction generated from the underlying (1-D) radial reference model and it far exceeds observational uncertainties currently being obtained from space-geodetic surveying. The relative impact of lateral viscosity variations on predicted radial motions is signiﬁcantly smaller.},

However, signiﬁcant physically important differences remain, including the magnitude of present-day vertical crustal motion in the embayments and in the spectrum of Stokes coefﬁcients for present-day geoid height time dependence which continues to “ﬂatten” at high spherical harmonic degree. We explore the reasons for these differences and trace them to the use by Purcell et al. of a loading history for the embayments that differs signiﬁcantly from that tabulated for both the original and modiﬁed versions of our model.},

	abstract = {A new model of the deglaciation history of Antarctica over the past 25 kyr has been developed, which we refer to herein as ICE-6G-C (VM5a). This revision of its predecessor ICE-5G (VM2) has been constrained to ﬁt all available geological and geodetic observations, consisting of: (1) the present day uplift rates at 42 sites estimated from GPS measurements, (2) ice thickness change at 62 locations estimated from exposure-age dating, (3) Holocene relative sea level histories from 12 locations estimated on the basis of radiocarbon dating and (4) age of the onset of marine sedimentation at nine locations along the Antarctic shelf also estimated on the basis of 14C dating. Our new model ﬁts the totality of these data well. An additional nine GPS-determined site velocities are also estimated for locations known to be inﬂuenced by modern ice loss from the Pine Island Bay and Northern Antarctic Peninsula regions. At the 42 locations not inﬂuenced by modern ice loss, the quality of the ﬁt of postglacial rebound model ICE-6G-C (VM5A) is characterized by a weighted root mean square residual of 0.9 mm yr–1. The Southern Antarctic Peninsula is inferred to be rising at 2 mm yr–1, requiring there to be less Holocene ice loss there than in the prior model ICE-5G (VM2). The East Antarctica coast is rising at approximately 1 mm yr–1, requiring ice loss from this region to have been small since Last Glacial Maximum. The Ellsworth Mountains, at the base of the Antarctic Peninsula, are inferred to be rising at 5–8 mm yr–1, indicating large ice loss from this area during deglaciation that is poorly sampled by geological data. Horizontal deformation of the Antarctic Plate is minor with two exceptions. First, O’Higgins, at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, is moving southeast at a signiﬁcant 2 mm yr–1 relative to the Antarctic Plate. Secondly, the margins of the Ronne and Ross Ice Shelves are moving horizontally away from the shelf centres at an approximate rate of 0.8 mm yr–1, in viscous response to the early Holocene unloading of ice from the current locations of the ice shelf centers. ICE-6G-C (VM5A) ﬁts the horizontal observations well (wrms residual speed of 0.7 mm yr–1), there being no need to invoke any inﬂuence of lateral variation in mantle viscosity. ICE-6G-C (VM5A) differs in several respects from the recently published W12A model of Whitehouse et al. First, the upper-mantle viscosity in VM5a is 5 × 1020 Pa s, half that in W12A. The VM5a proﬁle, which is identical to that inferred on the basis of the Fennoscandian relaxation spectrum, North American relative sea level histories and Earth rotation constraints, when coupled with the revised ICE-6G-C deglaciation history, ﬁts all of the available constraints. Secondly, the net contribution of Antarctica ice loss to global sea level rise is 13.6 m, 2/3 greater than the 8 m in W12A. Thirdly, ice loss occurs quickly from 12 to 5 ka, and the contribution to global sea level rise during Meltwater Pulse 1B (11.5 ka) is large (5 m), consistent with sedimentation constraints from cores from the Antarctica ice shelf. Fourthly, in ICE-6G-C there is no ice gain in the East Antarctica interior, as there is in W12A. Finally, the new model of Antarctic deglaciation reconciles the global constraint upon the global mass loss during deglaciation provided by the Barbados record of relative sea level history when coupled with the Northern Hemisphere counterpart of this new model.},

	abstract = {A new model of the last deglaciation event of the Late Quaternary ice age is here described and denoted as ICE-6G-C (VM5a). It differs from previously published models in this sequence in that it has been explicitly reﬁned by applying all of the available Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements of vertical motion of the crust that may be brought to bear to constrain the thickness of local ice cover as well as the timing of its removal. Additional space geodetic constraints have also been applied to specify the reference frame within which the GPS data are described. The focus of the paper is upon the three main regions of Last Glacial Maximum ice cover, namely, North America, Northwestern Europe/Eurasia, and Antarctica, although Greenland and the British Isles will also be included, if peripherally, in the discussion. In each of the three major regions, the model predictions of the time rate of change of the gravitational ﬁeld are also compared to that being measured by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment satellites as an independent means of verifying the improvement of the model achieved by applying the GPS constraints. Several aspects of the global characteristics of this new model are also discussed, including the nature of relative sea level history predictions at far-ﬁeld locations, in particular the Caribbean island of Barbados, from which especially high-quality records of postglacial sea level change are available but which records were not employed in the development of the model. Although ICE-6G-C (VM5a) is a signiﬁcant improvement insofar as the most recently available GPS observations are concerned, comparison of model predictions with such far-ﬁeld relative sea level histories enables us to identify a series of additional improvements that should follow from a further stage of model iteration.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Accurate glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) modelling in the cryosphere is required for interpreting satellite, geophysical and geological records
and for assessing the feedbacks of Earth deformation and sea-level change on marine ice-sheet grounding lines. GIA modelling in areas of active ice loss
in West Antarctica is particularly challenging because the ice is underlain by laterally varying mantle viscosities that are up to several orders of
magnitude lower than the global average, leading to a faster and more localised response of the solid Earth to ongoing and future ice-sheet retreat
and necessitating GIA models that incorporate 3-D viscoelastic Earth structure. Improvements to GIA models allow for computation of the viscoelastic
response of the Earth to surface ice loading at sub-kilometre resolution, and ice-sheet models and observational products now provide the inputs to
GIA models at comparably unprecedented detail. However, the resolution required to accurately capture GIA in models remains poorly understood, and
high-resolution calculations come at heavy computational expense. We adopt a 3-D GIA model with a range of Earth structure models based on recent
seismic tomography and geodetic data to perform a comprehensive analysis of the influence of grid resolution on predictions of GIA in the Amundsen
Sea Embayment (ASE) in West Antarctica. Through idealised sensitivity testing down to sub-kilometre resolution with spatially isolated ice loading
changes, we find that a grid resolution of ∼ 13 of the radius of the load or higher is required to accurately capture the elastic
response of the Earth. However, when we consider more realistic, spatially coherent ice loss scenarios based on modern observational records and
future ice-sheet model projections and adopt a viscoelastic Earth, we find that predicted deformation and sea-level change along the grounding line
converge to within 5 \% with grid resolutions of 7.5 km or higher, and to within 2 \% for grid resolutions of 3.75 km and
higher, even when the input ice model is on a 1 km grid. Furthermore, we show that low mantle viscosities beneath the ASE lead to viscous
deformation that contributes to the instrumental record on decadal timescales and equals or dominates over elastic effects by the end of the 21st
century. Our findings suggest that for the range of resolutions of 1.9–15 km that we considered, the error due to adopting a coarser grid
in this region is negligible compared to the effect of neglecting viscous effects and the uncertainty in the adopted mantle viscosity structure.},

Three classical approaches to ﬁltering of nonlinear systems are the extended, ensemble and unscented Kalman ﬁlters. The extended Kalman ﬁlter (which we refer to as ExKI in the context of inverse problems) is impractical when the forward map is not readily diﬀerentiable and given as a black box, and also for high dimensional parameter spaces because of the need to propagate large covariance matrices. Ensemble Kalman inversion (EKI) has emerged as a useful tool which overcomes both of these issues: it is derivative free and works with a lowrank covariance approximation formed from the ensemble. In this paper, we demonstrate that unscented Kalman methods also provide an eﬀective tool for derivative-free inversion in the setting of black-box forward models, introducing unscented Kalman inversion – UKI.},

In this paper, we aim to make the UKI more eﬃcient in terms of computational and memory costs for large scale inverse problems. We take advantages of the low-rank covariance structure to reduce the number of forward problem evaluations and the memory cost, related to the need to propagate large covariance matrices. And we leverage reduced-order model techniques to further speed up these forward evaluations. The eﬀectiveness of the enhanced UKI is demonstrated on a barotropic model inverse problem with O(105) unknown parameters and a 3D generalized circulation model (GCM) inverse problem, where each iteration is as eﬃcient as that of gradient-based optimization methods.},

In this paper we make an assessment of some aspects of the ICE6G-C(VM5a) model and show that the published present-day radial uplift rates are too high along the eastern side of the Antarctic Peninsula (by ∼8.6 mm/yr) and beneath the Ross Ice Shelf (by ∼5 mm/yr). Furthermore, the published spherical harmonic coeﬃcients—which are meant to represent the dimensionless present-day changes due to glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA)—contain excessive power for degree ≥90, do not agree with physical expectations and do not represent accurately the ICE6G-C(VM5a) model. We show that the excessive power in the high-degree terms produces erroneous uplift rates when the empirical relationship of Purcell et al. (2011) is applied, but when correct Stokes coeﬃcients are used, the empirical relationship produces excellent agreement with the fully rigorous computation of the radial velocity ﬁeld, subject to the caveats ﬁrst noted by Purcell et al. (2011). Using the Australian National University (ANU) groups CALSEA software package, we recompute the present-day GIA signal for the ice thickness history and Earth rheology used by Peltier et al. (2015) and provide dimensionless Stokes coeﬃcients that can be used to correct satellite altimetry observations for GIA over oceans and by the space gravity community to separate GIA and present-day mass balance change signals.

The deformation is controlled by elastic and viscous material parameters, which are inhomogeneous in the Earth. We present a new viscoelastic solid Earth deformation model in ASPECT (Advanced Solver for Problems in Earth's ConvecTion): a modern, massively parallel, open-source finite element code originally designed to simulate convection in the Earth's mantle. We show the performance of solid Earth deformation in ASPECT and compare solutions to TABOO, a semianalytical code, and Abaqus, a commercial finite element code. The maximum deformation and deformation rates using ASPECT agree within 2.6\% for the average percentage difference with TABOO and Abaqus on glacial cycle (∼100 kyr) and contemporary ice melt (∼100 years) timescales. This gives confidence in the performance of our new solid Earth deformation model. We also demonstrate the computational efficiency of using adaptively refined meshes, which is a great advantage for solid Earth deformation modeling. Furthermore, we demonstrate the model performance in the presence of lateral viscosity variations in the upper mantle and report on parallel scalability of the code. This benchmarked code can now be used to investigate regional solid Earth deformation rates from ice age and contemporary ice melt. This is especially interesting for low-viscosity regions in the upper mantle beneath Antarctica and Greenland, where it is not fully understood how ice age and contemporary ice melting contribute to geodetic measurements of solid Earth deformation.},

	abstract = {The mapping between far-ﬁeld relative sea level (RSL) records and changes in ice volume or global mean sea level (GMSL) involves a correction for glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA). This mapping is thus sensitive to uncertainties inherent to GIA modeling, including the spatio-temporal history of ice mass changes and viscoelastic Earth structure. Here, we investigate the effect of incorporating lateral variations in Earth structure on predicting far-ﬁeld sea level in order to determine if this source of model uncertainty signiﬁcantly impacts estimates of global ice volume at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). We consider a set of forty 3-D simulations that sample different Earth model parameters: the adopted lithospheric thickness, the seismic velocity model used to infer lateral temperature variations, the scaling factor used in the conversion from temperature to viscosity, and the spherically averaged “background” viscosity proﬁle. In addition, we consider results based on two ice histories. We present global maps of the differences between these simulations and a set of 1-D simulations at the LGM, as well as RSL histories at 5 locations that have been previously considered in estimates of ice volume at LGM: Barbados, two sites at the Great Barrier Reef, Bonaparte Gulf and Sunda Shelf. We ﬁnd that the difference between inferences of global mean sea level (GMSL) at LGM based on 3-D and 1-D Earth models peaks in Barbados with differences ranging from {\textasciitilde}2.5 to 11 m, with a mean of {\textasciitilde}6e7 m. At the other sites, the difference ranges from {\textasciitilde}2 to À8 m, with mean differences between {\textasciitilde}0 and À3 m. After comparing different pairs of simulations, we conclude that, in general, the impact of varying the seismic model, lithospheric thickness model, background 1-D model, and scaling factor from temperature to viscosity is signiﬁcant at far-ﬁeld sites. Finally, while we do not ﬁnd a consistent signal at the above far-ﬁeld sites that would help to reconcile the LGM ice volumes estimated from GIA studies and those estimated from summing regional ice sheet reconstructions, the impact is nonetheless large enough that GIA analyses of RSL records in the far ﬁeld of ice sheets should include 3-D viscoelastic Earth models.},

The decimal digit is meaningful: uncertainty is about ±0.1 Mm2 or ±0.03\%. Although it is impractical to quantify their dominant errors precisely, the ocean areas presented in both of the canonical sources are signiﬁcantly more uncertain. The often-quoted ﬁgure of 361 Mm2 probably derives from the work of Kossinna in 1921 and represents the ocean without the ice shelves and ﬂoating glacier tongues, which have an area at present of 1.561 Mm2. The often-quoted ﬁgure of 362 Mm2 probably derives from the work of Menard and Smith in 1966 and includes the ice shelves, as it should for the purpose of converting masses of cryospheric or terrestrial water to sea-level equivalent units. However, when Kossinna’s estimate is corrected by adding the ice shelves, the two canonical estimates are seen to be inconsistent. The discrepancy implies that measurement errors are much larger than estimated in one source or in both, but Kossinna’s estimate, when corrected, agrees much more closely with the modern digital estimates than does the Menard-Smith estimate.},
